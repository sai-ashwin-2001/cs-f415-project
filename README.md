Data Mining for Product Marketing Analytics
Problem Definition:
		
			The dataset is from an online store of sporting goods: clothing, shoes, accessories and sports nutrition. On the main page of the store, they show users banners in order to stimulate their sales. Now one of 5 banners is randomly displayed there. Each banner advertises a specific product or the entire company. The experience with banners can vary by segment, and their effectiveness may depend on the characteristics of user behaviour. Now the job is to test the effectiveness of these banners from the available data and strategically decide when and what should the banners show. 
 
For this purpose, we have attempted classification and clustering techniques on the dataset for customer segmentation, which is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. Then we have attempted Market Basket Analysis for analysing customer interests and buying patterns and established interesting patterns and correlations (for example, relating the time of user activity, the action of the user, product together)  using associative mining methods.
